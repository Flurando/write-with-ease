# write-with-ease

# Preface
This is just a beginner project which I hope to be the starter point in my technological path.
I had read the syntax of many programming languages like python, javascript, c++, c and even rust but I never ever wrote something real.
I wanted to, however, when I sit in front of my pc with a text editor (emacs) open, I don't know what to write. I once dreamed, oh! bittorrent is cool! Let me implement one called FLurandoBT! But when I checked the rfc online, I was scared -- the syntax is not enough and I don't even know how to center a div in html unless I prompt AI!
At that time, I really feel like a loser. Years passed, today, I finally decide to start a real project myself in order to drive myself learning.
From now on, I would not give up, not step back, solving all the problems that occurs and gaining whatever tech I need to finish this project.

#Content
Considering write-with-ease, I think the program should firstly be a text editor, tailored for writing.
However, it should not be a tool kit like vscode or emacs, nor shall it be a plugin box like sublime, atoms, or geany, never should it be like another OpenAI cli in the console. What it should be is as invisible as possible while still allowing users to write easily.
I mean, it should not have a huge GUI and should not block the current emulated terminal session, but being able to get input from the user and output that to some file that contains the written stuff.

#Howto
I plan to start with something simple and move towards my wish slowly.
