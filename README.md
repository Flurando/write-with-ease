# write-with-ease

# Preface
This is just a beginner project which I hope to be the starter point in my technological path.
I had read the syntax of many programming languages like python, javascript, c++, c and even rust but I never ever wrote something real.
I wanted to, however, when I sit in front of my pc with a text editor (emacs) open, I don't know what to write. I once dreamed, oh! bittorrent is cool! Let me implement one called FLurandoBT! But when I checked the rfc online, I was scared -- the syntax is not enough and I don't even know how to center a div in html unless I prompt AI!
At that time, I really feel like a loser. Years passed, today, I finally decide to start a real project myself in order to drive myself learning.
From now on, I would not give up, not step back, solving all the problems that occurs and gaining whatever tech I need to finish this project.

# Content
Considering write-with-ease, I think the program should firstly be a text editor, tailored for writing.
However, it should not be a tool kit like vscode or emacs, nor shall it be a plugin box like sublime, atoms, or geany, never should it be like another OpenAI cli in the console. What it should be is as invisible as possible while still allowing users to write easily.
I mean, it should not have a huge GUI and should not block the current emulated terminal session, but being able to get input from the user and output that to some file that contains the written stuff.

# Howto
I plan to start with something simple and move towards my wish slowly.

#NEWS
Recently I found out that on linux the stuff I described is already there and quite useful. With a manner like `cat > somewriting << EOF` for starting a new file and `cat >> somewriting << EOF` to append to a file, along with `sed` that can powerfully edit text if one understand s regex and `sed` itself. Also, for those who handle elisp well can just customize their emacs or just enjoy the already awesome functionalities as long as he or she is familiar with the binded keyboard actions.

I mean, it seems really little use to make such a toy which, compared to other projects, is only slightly more advanced than "Hello, World" or "guess a number between 1~100", even newbies can write one with the help of AI or just the document in a single day...But I will go on anywway, as long as I figured out some interesting things or more useful stuff to put here like extending the functionalities using FFI in guile scheme.(I haven't not only because I am not a powerful coder with other languages as well, nor because I haven't written a single makefile never to say using the GNU autotool...but because...Well, I can't think of an excuse now |:(| ! )
